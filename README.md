## Project Summary

This project aims to analyze the Wine Quality dataset, focusing on the characteristics that influence the quality of red and white Vinho Verde wines from northern Portugal. Through a comprehensive data analysis process using R, our team will explore physicochemical and sensory variables to understand their impact on wine quality. The goal is to identify key factors that contribute to the classification of wine quality and to predict the quality of wine samples effectively. Our approach will be rooted in reproducible and trustworthy workflows, ensuring that our findings are both reliable and accessible.

## How to Run This Analysis

To execute our data analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine to get started.

## Dataset Acknowledgement

This project utilizes the UCI Machine Learning Repository Wine Quality (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) dataset. The two datasets included are related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal behind the dataset is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.
