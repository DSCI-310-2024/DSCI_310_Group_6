## Project Summary

This project aims to analyze the Wine Quality dataset, focusing on the characteristics that influence the quality of red and white Vinho Verde wines from northern Portugal. Through a comprehensive data analysis process using R, our team will explore physicochemical and sensory variables to understand their impact on wine quality. The goal is to identify key factors that contribute to the classification of wine quality and to predict the quality of wine samples effectively. Our approach will be rooted in reproducible and trustworthy workflows, ensuring that our findings are both reliable and accessible.

## Dataset Acknowledgement

This project utilizes the UCI Machine Learning Repository Wine Quality (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) dataset. The two datasets included are related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal behind the dataset is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.

## Goal of Analysis

Our analysis aims to unravel the intricate relationship between the physicochemical properties of wine—specifically pH, residual sugar, chlorides, and sulphates—and their impact on the sensory quality ratings of red and white Vinho Verde wines. By assessing how these selected properties influence the wine's sensory perception, our objective is to quantify their collective impact on wine quality. This seeks not only to provide actionable insights for winemakers to enhance production processes but also to offer guidance to consumers in making informed wine selections. Additionally, our analysis aims to contribute to the academic field of oenology by advancing the understanding of how wine's chemical composition correlates with its perceived quality. Through this approach, we aim to highlight the physicochemical traits that are pivotal in determining high-quality wine, thereby aiding in the optimization of wine production and enriching the overall wine experience for both producers and consumers.
